# Java Machine Learning

This project is so that I can dip mm toes into machine learning.
Java probably isn't the best language but what ever.

# Goals

The end goal of this project is to be able to have a program parse through text books to find hard to comprehend sentances and find images/videos on the web to supplement them.

In the short term I just want to have a program that determins what a letter is.
More goals will be posted as I conquer my tasks.
